                  <h3>Course Description</h3>
                  <p>
                     Senior Projects provides a capstone experience for the major, culminating in a senior group
                     exhibition in June. You will work closely with faculty to focus on a project defined by your
                     individual skills and professional interests. Each project will develop from in-depth research,
                     conceptual development, prototype development, refinement, and production. You will work closely
                     with other students, engaging in the critical analysis and review of each other’s works.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  This course emphasizes the intersections between various video and animation practices, encouraging
                  interdisciplinary research. You are free to explore any of the skills and interests developed during
                  your time in DMA toward the creation of your final project. Work in all media will be considered.
                  Video is a machine for thinking, moving freely across various modalities of research: sociological,
                  semiotic, environmental, anthropological, technological, geopolitical.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>At each stage of the process we will consider audience, accessibility, reception, and distribution
                     of the work. We will consider the way each work interacts with other works in the context of a
                     group show. We will consider a range of approaches for documentation of time-based work. Alongside
                     each project, each artist will develop a plan for documenting and communicating their work after
                     the piece is de-installed.
                  </p>

                     </p> </br>
                     <p>Your work will be assessed according to your overall enthusiasm: The amount of time, effort,
                        and thought you contribute to the course; your willingness to explore, take risks, and
                        expand into a new range of experiences; attention to quality of ideas and quality in

                     </p>
                  </span>
                  <h3>Individual Meetings</h3>
                  <p>Much of the class time will be devoted to 1-on-1 meetings with the professor and TA. You should
                     prep for these meetings. Show new findings, discuss conclusions, and present your goals for the
                     following week. Make a list of questions beforehand that you want to discuss. Outside of these
                     meetings, keep in mind that you are also welcome to discuss your work with any professor you feel
                     could help you out. Your senior project professor might ask you to seek advice or have a meeting
                     with soemone specific to discuss your project. Be pro-active and report to your professor if this
                     was helpful. You are also welcome to come to class after the last scheduled meeting each day for
                     open office hours help.</p>
                  <h3>Process documentation</h3>
                  <p>The quarter is broken up into smaller assignments that will guide you on the path of creating your
                     senior project. It is recommended that you create a dedicated notebook or folder to track the
                     assigments and research materials you compile. It is essential that you meet these deadlines so you
                     don't fall behind. If you are struggling, talk to the professor or TA ahead of your meeting to
                     communicate the issue or confusion. Process documentation is worth 15% of your grade.</p>
                  <h3>Attendance</h3>
                  <p><i>If there is an emergency and you will be late or absent please email the instructor and TA.
                     </i></p>
                  </br>
                  <p>Communication is key. If you are late or absent, please send an email or a discord message
                     notifying your instructor immediately. Given the difficulty of navigating Covid-19 related
                     circumstances, we can discuss and modify course expectations on a case by case basis. The most
                     important thing is to communicate immediately if you encounter any difficulties so we can assist
                     and keep you on track to completing your senior project.</p>


                  <h3>Participation</h3>
                  <p>Participation and risk-taking are essential parts of this course; come prepared, work hard, and
                     share your work and ideas generously with your fellow students and faculty.</p></br>
                  <p>Students will be required to present their own work and to thoughtfully analyze, discuss, and
                     critique the work of their classmates during lab sessions and full class meetings.
                  </p></br>
                  <p>Participation includes:
                  <ul>
                     <li>Weekly meetings with your instructor and TA</li>
                     <li>Weekly meetings with lab groups</li>
                     <li>Full class and join class meetings, discussions, and presentations</li>
                     <li>Weekly solo writing meditation practice</li>
                     <li>Completion of senior project/committment to solo studio practice</li>
                  </ul>
                  </p>

                  <h3>Late Assignments</h3>
                  <p>If you miss deadlines due to valid, extenuating circumstances you may submit the required
                     work at a date agreed upon with us. Please contact the instructor or TA to discuss modifying the
                     deadline
                     prior to the original deadline.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Managing Media</h3>
                  <p>Make a backup of all media. Render / Export well in advance of any deadline.</p>

                  <h3>Consent</h3>
                  <p>You must have the explicit consent of any person appearing within your work.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Commitment to Equity and Diversity</h3>
                  <p>We understand the classroom as a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic,
                     social, and cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. To do so we must
                     acknowledge and embrace the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit. A collaborative effort
                     between the students and the teacher is needed for creating a supportive learning environment.
                  </p></br>
                  <p>While everyone should feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually, if a class member points
                     out that something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, avoid being defensive;
                     instead approach the discussion as an opportunity for everyone to grow and learn from one another.
                     All class members are encouraged to discuss such instances with the instructor so they can be
                     addressed with greater care in the future.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Students with Special Needs</h3>
                  <p>Students needing academic accommodations based on a disability should contact the Center for
                     Accessible Education (CAE) at (310)825-1501 or in person at Murphy Hall A255. In order to ensure
                     accommodations, students need to contact the CAE within the first two weeks of the term.

                  projects
                  during the semester. You are expected to work on your projects outside of class unless it is a
                  designated open-studio session or if you finish your workshop exercises early.</p>
               <br>
               <p>Each project requires a weekly update. On the schedule, they are listed as <span
                     class="hiProj">"Project Weekly Checkpoint"</span>. You complete a checkpoint by sharing images,
                  videos, or
                  related media from your project and a written summary of the tasks or progress you've made. If you are
                  having issues or concerns on your project, this is the time to express them. Weekly checkpoints are
                  crucial to ensure you are on track to finishing your projects. You will be graded on these updates.

                  <h4>Description</h4>
                  <p>"What Just Happened?" you ask yourself. The last thing you remember is a flash of white light
                     and now you seem to be in some kind of waiting room. You're asked to take a number and have
                     a seat. The blades on the ceiling fan whirl in hypnotic fashion. Slowed-down swing music
                     plays through the intercom speakers. There are other people around you. They are mostly
                     individuals, much older than yourself,
                     but there is a young boy sitting on his father's lap. Both your eyes meet with the same
                     confused
                     gaze. When your number is called, you move to a new room. There
                     are windows that overlook the overcast sky and bare trees against the building. It looks
                     chilly.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                     <i>Where is this? Where am I?</i>
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                     Everything is too common but the place is unfamiliar. The dull, grey light
                     framed by the windows illuminates the surface of a wooden table. A
                     man sitting at the table gestures toward the empty chair across from
                     him. Taking the cue, you walk towards him and sit down.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Here, you're informed of your recent passing. You're dead. So is everyone else around you.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p> "...I'm sorry for your loss..." the man says. He bows his head and closes
                     his eyes. You're both silent for a few moments.
                  </p>
                  <p>You're informed that you are in an in-between space between life and afterlife <span
                        class="highlight">**</span>. You are to stay here for several weeks where you will be
                     given a private room to live the last of your days and take on a final project.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>The man elaborates on this project, "...while you are here, you must select one memory. One
                     memory that was most meaningful or precious to you. Once you have chosen your memory, you
                     will try your best to re-create this memory on video. You can use the many skills, tools,
                     and media already available to you before you arrived here. We will screen these at the end
                     of your stay, along with the others you may have seen in our waiting room earlier today. As
                     soon as you have relived your memory, you will move on. Taking only the memory with you."
                  </p><br>
                  <p><i>This effort to represent memories using media is more a creative endeavor than an accurate
                        one-to-one depiction of what actually happened and what you remember. How can you
                        situate the video you make for this project in this volatile, affective reality?</i>
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                     <span class="highlight">**</span> <i>afterlife is used subjectively and can mean anything (or
                        nothing) to you.</i>

                  <p>
                     Develop a project proposal for your video that can be
                     clearly
                     communicated to others. As usual, this proposal is non-binding and subject to change. Your
                     proposal should include a minimum of the following:
                  <ul>
                     <li>A mediated explanation of your chosen memory. You can write
                        it down, do a voice recording, a video recording, or collect media materials related to
                        your
                        memory.
                     </li>
                     <li>A 9-panel storyboard: Your storyboard can be either hand-drawn, digital, or prototyped using
                        3D software. If time permits, explore a combination of these methods to push your sketches
                        closer to your mental image. Your storyboard should plan for a minimum of 2 minutes of
                        animation.</li>
                     <ul>

                     <li>400-word written statement: In your written response, explain your concept, the emotional
                        weight and the mood of the piece, how do you plan to execute it, and what software(s) are you
                        planning to use.</li>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Example: “I’m creating a piece about the excessive use of technology and its permeation
                           in daily life…To achieve this my piece will primarily explore an imagined table filled
                           with electronic, gadgets, and trash…I will be using Blender for my 3D needs and After
                           Effects for post-processing and compositing…”</li>
                     </ul>
                     <li>References and mood board: You should include a mood board (minimum 10 images/videos) in
                        your proposal that convey your vision more clearly. Use these references to communicate your
                        piece’s mood and environment, as well as materials and visual presentation.</li>
                     <li>Sounds/Music: Submit a minimum of 1 audio pieces that convey the mood of your animation
                        piece. Include these as links in your PDF file.
                     </li>

                  <p>Your final project is an open investigation of your interests and the techniques learned
                     throughout the course that culminate into a single video. Your project must synthesize the course
                     materials and techniques
                     and/or respond to some of the subjects discussed in the class. It must be paired with audio
                     which can be
                     musical, ambient, environmental, or experimental. The required length of the project is 2+ minutes.
                     You are free to explore any topic that interests you. These can range from
                     exploration of advanced and experimental techniques, software and frameworks that were not
                     touched on in the class, social and political issues, personal and interpersonal
                     investigations, investigations of aesthetics, etc. Collaboration, invention, and exploration
                     are highly encouraged. Your final projects will be exhibited online on a dedicated website.
