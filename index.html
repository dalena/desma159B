                  <h3>Course Description</h3>
                  <p>
                     Senior Projects provides a capstone experience for the major, culminating in a senior group
                     exhibition in June. You will work closely with faculty to focus on a project defined by your
                     individual skills and professional interests. Each project will develop from in-depth research,
                     conceptual development, prototype development, refinement, and production. You will work closely
                     with other students, engaging in the critical analysis and review of each other's works.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  This course emphasizes the intersections between various video and animation practices, encouraging
                  interdisciplinary research. You are free to explore any of the skills and interests developed during
                  your time in DMA toward the creation of your final project. Work in all media will be considered.
                  Video is a machine for thinking, moving freely across various modalities of research: sociological,
                  semiotic, environmental, anthropological, technological, geopolitical.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>At each stage of the process we will consider audience, accessibility, reception, and distribution
                     of the work. We will consider the way each work interacts with other works in the context of a
                     group show. We will consider a range of approaches for documentation of time-based work. Alongside
                     each project, each artist will develop a plan for documenting and communicating their work after
                     the piece is de-installed.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Attendance</h3>

                  <p>Communication is key. If you are late or absent, please send an email notifying Issac (<a
                        href="mailto:isaacruder@g.ucla.edu" target="_blank">isaacruder@g.ucla.edu</a>) and CC me (<a
                        href="mailto:dalena@g.ucla.edu" target="_blank">dalena@g.ucla.edu</a>) immediately. Given the
                     difficulty of navigating Covid-19 related
                     circumstances, we can discuss and modify course expectations on a case by case basis. The most
                     important thing is to communicate immediately if you encounter any difficulties so we can assist
                     and keep you on track to completing your senior project.</p>

                  <h3>Participation</h3>
                  <p>Participation and risk-taking are essential parts of this course; come prepared, work hard, and
                     share your work and ideas generously with your fellow students and faculty.</p></br>
                  <p>Students will be required to present their own work and to thoughtfully analyze, discuss, and
                     critique the work of their classmates during lab sessions and full class meetings.
                  </p></br>
                  <p>Participation includes:
                  <ul>
                     <li>Weekly meetings with your instructor and TA</li>
                     <li>Full class and join class meetings, discussions, and presentations</li>
                     <li>Weekly solo writing meditation practice/updates</li>
                     <li>Completion of senior project/committment to solo studio practice</li>
                  </ul>
                  </p>

                  <h3>Other Things to Consider</h3>
                  <ul>
                     <li>See your Senior Project / graduation project as your first introduction to
                        the professional world (DMA organized a Career Day with interviews during and
                        at the Senior Show) - Your graduation project should build on what already
                        is showing in your portfolio. Recognize your strengths, and use those skills
                        rather then work in a medium that you have no experience in.</li>
                     <li>Keep in mind that you can discuss your work with any professor you feel
                        could help you out. Your Senior Project professors might ask you to seek
                        advice or have a meeting with someone specific to discuss your project.
                        Be pro-active and report to your professor if this was helpful.</li>
                     <li>Prep for your one-on-one meetings with your professor. Show new findings
                        and discuss conclusions and further sketches so they are informed about where
                        you are at during the design process. Make a list of questions that you want
                        to discuss. - At some point around week 5 you will have a meeting with your
                        professor to discuss the project that will be in the Senior Show. This will be
                        either your new project, or it will be a former project, with the discussion
                        of what to improve, and how to show this project in the gallery.</li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3>Managing Media</h3>
                  <p>Make a backup of all media. Render / Export well in advance of any deadline.</p>

                  <h3>Consent</h3>
                  <p>You must have the explicit consent of any person appearing within your work.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Commitment to Equity and Diversity</h3>
                  <p>We understand the classroom as a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic,
                     social, and cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. To do so we must
                     acknowledge and embrace the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit. A collaborative effort
                     between the students and the teacher is needed for creating a supportive learning environment.
                  </p></br>
                  <p>While everyone should feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually, if a class member points
                     out that something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, avoid being defensive;
                     instead approach the discussion as an opportunity for everyone to grow and learn from one another.
                     All class members are encouraged to discuss such instances with the instructor so they can be
                     addressed with greater care in the future.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Students with Special Needs</h3>
                  <p>Students needing academic accommodations based on a disability should contact the Center for
                     Accessible Education (CAE) at (310)825-1501 or in person at Murphy Hall A255. In order to ensure
                     accommodations, students need to contact the CAE within the first two weeks of the term.
                  </p>

               <h2>Weekly Writing Meditations
               </h2>
               <p>Find a place (and a way) to write without interruption once a week.</p>
               <p>Set a timer. Actively write for 30 min each session unless otherwise noted in the prompt.</p>
               <p>Pause at 30 min and assess the writing.</p>
               <p>Continue if the writing feels generative, keep going, get all the loose thoughts down.</p>
               <p>Due in class on Mondays (with the exception of Meditation 1) </p>
               <p>We will discuss the results of the meditations in our weekly meeting</p>
               <br>

                  <h4>Inquiry</h4>
                  <p>List as many questions as you can about the project you are attempting.
                     Do not compose answers at the moment, simply list the questions that emerge
                     Abstract or Concrete, large or small, write down all questions that arise.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>What materials can I use?<br>
                     What will be the overall look and feel? <br>
                     What are my 'points of view' toward the subject matter?<br>
                     Who has dealt with this problem before?</p>

                  <h4>Tactics</h4>
                  <p>Write a list of tactics, a personal guide to the strategies that help you do your work. These can
                     be as simple as “rules” as in: 'try shifting scale' or 'walk until an idea forms'... </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>It can be a list of verbs— what are the actions that help you begin, or help you in moments of
                     uncertainty? It can be a short manifesto of personal poetics or statement about the ethical
                     considerations about your own work. Any length and format.</p>

                  <p><b><i>Part One</i></b></p>
                  <p>Diagram. Place main theme of your project at the centre. Visually arrange other keywords/themes
                     around the central one. Don't hold back, include any idea, theme, question that factors into your
                     project, place ones you're unsure of at the margins.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p><b><i>Part Two</i></b></p>
                  <p>Now analyze : are there differences between your project in progress and your idealized concept
                     diagram? What are these differences? Analyze why might these differences be present (are there
                     certain subjects you are shying away from or are more difficult to articulate-- if so why)?</p><br>
                  <p>Are there elements of the concept diagram that have yet to be emphasized in the final project? Make
                     a list.</p>
                  <p>How can you better emphasize these core ideas? Make a list.</p>
                  <p>How can you make sure to preserve some of the smaller / more nuanced nodes of the diagram? Make a
                     list.</p>
                  <p>What are some specific changes you might introduce in order to emphasis these ideas within your
                     final project-- strategies to heighten, underscore, bring attention to the ideas at play (ie.
                     repetition, scale, duration, color etc.) Make a list.</p>

                  <br>
