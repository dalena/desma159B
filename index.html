                  <h3>Course Description</h3>
                  <p>
                     Senior Projects provides a capstone experience for the major, culminating in a senior group exhibition in June. You will work closely with faculty to focus on a project defined by your individual skills and professional interests. Each project will develop from in-depth research, conceptual development, prototype development, refinement, and production. You will work closely with other students, engaging in the critical analysis and review of each other’s works.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                     This course emphasizes the intersections between various video and animation practices, encouraging interdisciplinary research. You are free to explore any of the skills and interests developed during your time in DMA toward the creation of your final project. Work in all media will be considered. Video is a machine for thinking, moving freely across various modalities of research: sociological, semiotic, environmental, anthropological, technological, geopolitical. 
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>At each stage of the process we will consider audience, accessibility, reception, and distribution of the work. We will consider the way each work interacts with other works in the context of a group show. We will consider a range of approaches for documentation of time-based work. Alongside each project, each artist will develop a plan for documenting and communicating their work after the piece is de-installed.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Learning Goals</h3>

                     <p>Outstanding or exceptional work will receive As, good work will receive Bs, sufficient work that does nothing more than meet requirements will receive Cs.
                     </p> </br>
                     <p>Your work will be assessed according to your overall enthusiasm: The amount of time, effort,
                        and thought you contribute to the course; your willingness to explore, take risks, and
                        expand into a new range of experiences; attention to quality of ideas and quality in
                        execution of your ideas; critical thought; skills in craft according to assignment
                        objectives; an understanding of materials presented in class and an ability to relate course
                        materials to discussions, assignments, and your own art practice.
                     </p>
                  </span>
                  <h3>Individual Meetings</h3>
                  <p>Much of the class time will be devoted to 1-on-1 meetings with the professor and TA. You should prep for these meetings. Show new findings, discuss conclusions, and present your goals for the following week. Make a list of questions beforehand that you want to discuss. Outside of these meetings, keep in mind that you are also welcome to discuss your work with any professor you feel could help you out. Your senior project professor might ask you to seek advice or have a meeting with soemone specific to discuss your project. Be pro-active and report to your professor if this was helpful. You are also welcome to come to class after the last scheduled meeting each day for open office hours help.</p>
                  <h3>Process documentation</h3>
                  <p>The quarter is broken up into smaller assignments that will guide you on the path of creating your senior project. It is recommended that you create a dedicated notebook or folder to track the assigments and research materials you compile. It is essential that you meet these deadlines so you don't fall behind. If you are struggling, talk to the professor or TA ahead of your meeting to communicate the issue or confusion. Process documentation is worth 15% of your grade.</p>
                  <h3>Attendance</h3>
               <p><i>If there is an emergency and you will be late or absent please email the instructor and TA.
               </i></p>   
               </br>
                  <p>Communication is key. If you are late or absent, please send an email or a discord message notifying your instructor immediately. Given the difficulty of navigating Covid-19 related circumstances, we can discuss and modify course expectations on a case by case basis. The most important thing is to communicate immediately if you encounter any difficulties so we can assist and keep you on track to completing your senior project.</p>

                  
                  <h3>Participation</h3>
                  <p>Participation and risk-taking are essential parts of this course; come prepared, work hard, and share your work and ideas generously with your fellow students and faculty.</p></br>
                  <p>Students will be required to present their own work and to thoughtfully analyze, discuss, and critique the work of their classmates during lab sessions and full class meetings.
                  </p></br>
                  <p>Participation includes:
                     <ul>
                        <li>Weekly meetings with your instructor and TA</li>
                        <li>Weekly meetings with lab groups</li>
                        <li>Full class and join class meetings, discussions, and presentations</li>
                        <li>Weekly solo writing meditation practice</li>
                        <li>Completion of senior project/committment to solo studio practice</li>
                     </ul>
                  </p>
                  
                  <h3>Late Assignments</h3>
                  <p>If you miss deadlines due to valid, extenuating circumstances you may submit the required
                     work at a date agreed upon with us. Please contact the instructor or TA to discuss modifying the deadline
                     prior to the original deadline.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Managing Media</h3>
                  <p>Make a backup of all media. Render / Export well in advance of any deadline.</p>

                  <h3>Consent</h3>
                  <p>You must have the explicit consent of any person appearing within your work.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Commitment to Equity and Diversity</h3>
                  <p>We understand the classroom as a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic, social, and cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. To do so we must acknowledge and embrace the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit. A collaborative effort between the students and the teacher is needed for creating a supportive learning environment.
                  </p></br>
                  <p>While everyone should feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually, if a class member points out that something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, avoid being defensive; instead approach the discussion as an opportunity for everyone to grow and learn from one another. All class members are encouraged to discuss such instances with the instructor so they can be addressed with greater care in the future.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Students with Special Needs</h3>
                  <p>Students needing academic accommodations based on a disability should contact the Center for Accessible Education (CAE) at (310)825-1501 or in person at Murphy Hall A255. In order to ensure accommodations, students need to contact the CAE within the first two weeks of the term.

                  Your exercises will be presented in class to launch us into discussions about exploration,
                  process, and form. The skills and techniques gained from our exercises will equip us with
                  strategies to produce our class projects.

                     <p>Exercise 1 will begin our journey into using Blender's grease pencil. Each student will draw out
                        a claw machine and create a simple animation using basic grease pencil animation, effects, and
                        modifiers. This exercise will introduce students to Blender shortcuts, the difference between
                        materials and vertex painting, and much more.</p>

                     <p>Exercise 2 will continue our learning in Blender's grease pencil with a focus on frame by frame,
                        hand-drawn animation. Each student will draw out
                        a linear perspective background and collectively rotoscope an entire animation by delegating a
                        portion of frames among each student. Through the practice of rotoscoping, students will be
                        introduced to how 2D animation works in Blender's Grease Pencil. By the end of this exercise, we
                        will combine the disparate background scenes and rotoscoping animation into a single video to
                        create an exquisite corpse-style moving image work.</p>

                     <h4>Description</h4>
                     <p>Create a virtual memory palace that contain media elements collected from your past. Design a
                        floor plan and build it out architecturally in Blender. Collect a variety of media
                        elements from your life or are a reminder of moments from your life (images, videos, audio) and
                        place them spatially throughout your 3D space. You will add
                        3D artifacts that activate the spaces further. Lastly, you will animate the camera throughout
                        your architectural structure to create a moving image work of the space informed by the medial
                        elements and virtual objects composed in your scene. This exercise will challenge you to think
                        creatively about virtual spaces and how the experience of media is informed by spatial
                        composition.

                        <h4>PART ONE</h4>
                        Collect <b><u>10 gifs</u></b>.

                        contain hateful, violent, or offensive material, it may not make it into the collection.
                        <ul>
                           <li>Images should be larger than 200px</li>

                        <h4>PART TWO</h4>
                        To be completed in our class workshop. We will each create a short collage video using only the
                        images from our curated database. This exercise will utilize the exhibition practices
                        inherit in Instagram's grid feature. Collages will be uploaded onto our class Instagram
                        account as they are generated.

                        <h4>PART THREE</h4>
                        <p>You will do the same as in part two, producing a completely new short collage video but in
                           sequential order. One after another, each student will have 4 days to generate a moving
                           collage using only the
                           images from our curated database. A new rule is that you MUST use one image from the previous
                           person's collage but no more than one.

                        <p>This exercise is designed to challenge this course's implications of what a "moving
                           image" is. Instead of contextualizing moving images purely within the scope of
                           time-based art (usually resulting in a video format), this exercise asks us to consider
                           how digital images may move within social spaces, digital platforms, data
                           infrastructures; how images today are consumed, curated, manipulated, generated,
                           disseminated, and exhibited; how digital images may contribute to larger technological
                           and social structures in our daily lives.

               <p>Projects demonstrate your attention to creativity and craft. Our class is structured around two
                  projects
                  during the semester. You are expected to work on your projects outside of class unless it is a
                  designated open-studio session or if you finish your workshop exercises early.</p>
               <br>
               <p>Each project requires a weekly update. On the schedule, they are listed as <span
                     class="hiProj">"Project Weekly Checkpoint"</span>. You complete a checkpoint by sharing images,
                  videos, or
                  related media from your project and a written summary of the tasks or progress you've made. If you are
                  having issues or concerns on your project, this is the time to express them. Weekly checkpoints are
                  crucial to ensure you are on track to finishing your projects. You will be graded on these updates.

                  <h4>Description</h4>
                  <p>"What Just Happened?" you ask yourself. The last thing you remember is a flash of white light
                     and now you seem to be in some kind of waiting room. You're asked to take a number and have
                     a seat. The blades on the ceiling fan whirl in hypnotic fashion. Slowed-down swing music
                     plays through the intercom speakers. There are other people around you. They are mostly
                     individuals, much older than yourself,
                     but there is a young boy sitting on his father's lap. Both your eyes meet with the same
                     confused
                     gaze. When your number is called, you move to a new room. There
                     are windows that overlook the overcast sky and bare trees against the building. It looks
                     chilly.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                     <i>Where is this? Where am I?</i>
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>
                     Everything is too common but the place is unfamiliar. The dull, grey light
                     framed by the windows illuminates the surface of a wooden table. A
                     man sitting at the table gestures toward the empty chair across from
                     him. Taking the cue, you walk towards him and sit down.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>Here, you're informed of your recent passing. You're dead. So is everyone else around you.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p> "...I'm sorry for your loss..." the man says. He bows his head and closes
                     his eyes. You're both silent for a few moments.
                  </p>
                  <p>You're informed that you are in an in-between space between life and afterlife <span
                        class="highlight">**</span>. You are to stay here for several weeks where you will be
                     given a private room to live the last of your days and take on a final project.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>The man elaborates on this project, "...while you are here, you must select one memory. One
                     memory that was most meaningful or precious to you. Once you have chosen your memory, you
                     will try your best to re-create this memory on video. You can use the many skills, tools,
                     and media already available to you before you arrived here. We will screen these at the end
                     of your stay, along with the others you may have seen in our waiting room earlier today. As
                     soon as you have relived your memory, you will move on. Taking only the memory with you."
                  </p><br>
                  <p><i>This effort to represent memories using media is more a creative endeavor than an accurate
                        one-to-one depiction of what actually happened and what you remember. How can you
                        situate the video you make for this project in this volatile, affective reality?</i>

                  <p>
                     <span class="highlight">**</span> <i>afterlife is used subjectively and can mean anything (or
                        nothing) to you.</i>

                     Develop a project proposal for your video that can be
                     clearly
                     communicated to others. As usual, this proposal is non-binding and subject to change. Your
                     proposal should include a minimum of the following:
                     <ul>
                        <li>A mediated explanation of your chosen memory. You can write
                           it down, do a voice recording, a video recording, or collect media materials related to
                           your
                           memory.
                        </li>
                        <li>A 9-panel storyboard: Your storyboard can be either hand-drawn, digital, or prototyped using
                           3D software. If time permits, explore a combination of these methods to push your sketches
                           closer to your mental image. Your storyboard should plan for a minimum of 2 minutes of
                           animation.</li>

                              with electronic, gadgets, and trash…I will be using Blender for my 3D needs and After

                        </ul>
                        <li>References and mood board: You should include a mood board (minimum 10 images/videos) in
                           your proposal that convey your vision more clearly. Use these references to communicate your
                           piece’s mood and environment, as well as materials and visual presentation.</li>
                        <li>Sounds/Music: Submit a minimum of 1 audio pieces that convey the mood of your animation
                           piece. Include these as links in your PDF file.

                  <p>Your final project is an open investigation of your interests and the techniques learned
                     throughout the course that culminate into a single video. Your project must synthesize the course
                     materials and techniques
                     and/or respond to some of the subjects discussed in the class. It must be paired with audio
                     which can be
                     musical, ambient, environmental, or experimental. The required length of the project is 2+ minutes.
                     You are free to explore any topic that interests you. These can range from
                     exploration of advanced and experimental techniques, software and frameworks that were not
                     touched on in the class, social and political issues, personal and interpersonal
                     investigations, investigations of aesthetics, etc. Collaboration, invention, and exploration
                     are highly encouraged. Your final projects will be exhibited online on a dedicated website.

                     Develop a project proposal for your video that can be
                     clearly
                     communicated to others:
                     <ul>
                        <li>Prepare a storyboard, an outline, a
                           moodboard, a set of diagrams, drawings, and/or text.
                        </li>
                        <li>Describe and define aspects of your project conceptually and technically in a few
                           paragraphs. Some questions to help you:
                        </li>
                        <ul>
                           <li>What emotions or ideas do you intend to convey to your viewer? Is there a
                              specific story? Is it more abstract?
                           </li>
                           <li>What aspects of your project are planned and what room in your creative process
                              and execution have you left for yourself to experiment?
                           </li>
                           <li>What techniques, methods, and/or softwares are you using?
                           </li>
                           <li>What parts of your project are you unfamiliar with and would need to spend more
                              time on?
                           </li>
                           <li>Based on all of these reflections, will you be able to accomplish it in time?
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Export your proposal as a PDF</li>

                     This project overview only applies to <u>those who are repeating this course for a second time</u>.
                     If this is the first time you are taking 4101, this is NOT you! Moreover, if you are repeating this
                     course and want to follow the standard syllabus this does not apply to you either.


                     Rough timeline of deliverables and development plan for the next 12 weeks.
                     A detailed storyboard, of your project is narrative work, or a mood board if your project does not
                     follow conventional linear storytelling and narratives.
                     A list of artists whose work you find inspiring in realizing your own project. These can be curated
                     based on aesthetics, technique, software, and/or concept.
                     List of the software you are using and how you plan to use them.

                  <h5>Note: As you progress through your project, we understand that things change. Creative work is
                     part accident, part intention. This proposal enables us to better assist you in realizing your
                     project and to follow and track your progress along the way. It is not a binding contract, so don’t
                     worry if things change. Your proposal helps you, me, and your peers understand the scope of your
                     project,
                     the elements you are working with, the limitations and constraints you may run up
