                  <h3>Course Description</h3>
                  <p>
                     Senior Projects provides a capstone experience for the major, culminating in a senior group
                     exhibition in June. You will work closely with faculty to focus on a project defined by your
                     individual skills and professional interests. Each project will develop from in-depth research,
                     conceptual development, prototype development, refinement, and production. You will work closely
                     with other students, engaging in the critical analysis and review of each other's works.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  This course emphasizes the intersections between various video and animation practices, encouraging
                  interdisciplinary research. You are free to explore any of the skills and interests developed during
                  your time in DMA toward the creation of your final project. Work in all media will be considered.
                  Video is a machine for thinking, moving freely across various modalities of research: sociological,
                  semiotic, environmental, anthropological, technological, geopolitical.
                  </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>At each stage of the process we will consider audience, accessibility, reception, and distribution
                     of the work. We will consider the way each work interacts with other works in the context of a
                     group show. We will consider a range of approaches for documentation of time-based work. Alongside
                     each project, each artist will develop a plan for documenting and communicating their work after
                     the piece is de-installed.
                  </p>

                     </p> </br>
                     <p>Your work will be assessed according to your overall enthusiasm: The amount of time, effort,
                        and thought you contribute to the course; your willingness to explore, take risks, and
                        expand into a new range of experiences; attention to quality of ideas and quality in
                        execution of your ideas; critical thought; skills in craft according to assignment
                        objectives; an understanding of materials presented in class and an ability to relate course

                     </p>
                  </span>
                  <h3>Individual Meetings</h3>
                  <p>Much of the class time will be devoted to 1-on-1 meetings with the professor and TA. You should
                     prep for these meetings. Show new findings, discuss conclusions, and present your goals for the
                     following week. Make a list of questions beforehand that you want to discuss. Outside of these
                     meetings, keep in mind that you are also welcome to discuss your work with any professor you feel
                     could help you out. Your senior project professor might ask you to seek advice or have a meeting
                     with soemone specific to discuss your project. Be pro-active and report to your professor if this
                     was helpful. You are also welcome to come to class after the last scheduled meeting each day for
                     open office hours help.</p>
                  <h3>Process documentation</h3>
                  <p>The quarter is broken up into smaller assignments that will guide you on the path of creating your
                     senior project. It is recommended that you create a dedicated notebook or folder to track the
                     assigments and research materials you compile. It is essential that you meet these deadlines so you
                     don't fall behind. If you are struggling, talk to the professor or TA ahead of your meeting to
                     communicate the issue or confusion. Process documentation is worth 15% of your grade.</p>
                  <h3>Attendance</h3>
                  <p><i>If there is an emergency and you will be late or absent please email the instructor and TA.
                     </i></p>
                  </br>
                  <p>Communication is key. If you are late or absent, please send an email or a discord message
                     notifying your instructor immediately. Given the difficulty of navigating Covid-19 related
                     circumstances, we can discuss and modify course expectations on a case by case basis. The most
                     important thing is to communicate immediately if you encounter any difficulties so we can assist
                     and keep you on track to completing your senior project.</p>


                  <h3>Participation</h3>
                  <p>Participation and risk-taking are essential parts of this course; come prepared, work hard, and
                     share your work and ideas generously with your fellow students and faculty.</p></br>
                  <p>Students will be required to present their own work and to thoughtfully analyze, discuss, and
                     critique the work of their classmates during lab sessions and full class meetings.
                  </p></br>
                  <p>Participation includes:
                  <ul>
                     <li>Weekly meetings with your instructor and TA</li>
                     <li>Weekly meetings with lab groups</li>
                     <li>Full class and join class meetings, discussions, and presentations</li>
                     <li>Weekly solo writing meditation practice</li>
                     <li>Completion of senior project/committment to solo studio practice</li>
                  </ul>
                  </p>

                  <h3>Late Assignments</h3>
                  <p>If you miss deadlines due to valid, extenuating circumstances you may submit the required
                     work at a date agreed upon with us. Please contact the instructor or TA to discuss modifying the
                     deadline
                     prior to the original deadline.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Managing Media</h3>
                  <p>Make a backup of all media. Render / Export well in advance of any deadline.</p>

                  <h3>Consent</h3>
                  <p>You must have the explicit consent of any person appearing within your work.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Commitment to Equity and Diversity</h3>
                  <p>We understand the classroom as a space for practicing freedom; where one may challenge psychic,
                     social, and cultural borders and create meaningful artistic expressions. To do so we must
                     acknowledge and embrace the different identities and backgrounds we inhabit. A collaborative effort
                     between the students and the teacher is needed for creating a supportive learning environment.
                  </p></br>
                  <p>While everyone should feel free to experiment creatively and conceptually, if a class member points
                     out that something you have said or shared with the group is offensive, avoid being defensive;
                     instead approach the discussion as an opportunity for everyone to grow and learn from one another.
                     All class members are encouraged to discuss such instances with the instructor so they can be
                     addressed with greater care in the future.
                  </p>

                  <h3>Students with Special Needs</h3>
                  <p>Students needing academic accommodations based on a disability should contact the Center for
                     Accessible Education (CAE) at (310)825-1501 or in person at Murphy Hall A255. In order to ensure
                     accommodations, students need to contact the CAE within the first two weeks of the term.
                  </p>

               <h2>Weekly Writing Meditations
               </h2>
               <p>Find a place (and a way) to write without interruption once a week.</p>
               <p>Set a timer. Actively write for 30 min each session unless otherwise noted in the prompt.</p>
               <p>Pause at 30 min and assess the writing.</p>
               <p>Continue if the writing feels generative, keep going, get all the loose thoughts down.</p>
               <p>Due in class on Mondays (with the exception of Meditation 1) </p>
               <p>We will discuss the results of the meditations in our weekly meeting</p>

                  <h4>Inquiry</h4>
                  <p>List as many questions as you can about the project you are attempting.
                     Do not compose answers at the moment, simply list the questions that emerge
                     Abstract or Concrete, large or small, write down all questions that arise.

                  <p>Write a list of tactics, a personal guide to the strategies that help you do your work. These can
                     be as simple as “rules” as in: 'try shifting scale' or 'walk until an idea forms'... </p>
                  <br>
                  <p>It can be a list of verbs— what are the actions that help you begin, or help you in moments of
                     uncertainty? It can be a short manifesto of personal poetics or statement about the ethical
                     considerations about your own work. Any length and format.</p>

                  <p>Now analyze : are there differences between your project in progress and your idealized concept
                     diagram? What are these differences? Analyze why might these differences be present (are there
                     certain subjects you are shying away from or are more difficult to articulate-- if so why)?</p><br>
                  <p>Are there elements of the concept diagram that have yet to be emphasized in the final project? Make
                     a list.</p>
                  <p>How can you better emphasize these core ideas? Make a list.</p>
                  <p>How can you make sure to preserve some of the smaller / more nuanced nodes of the diagram? Make a
                     list.</p>
                  <p>What are some specific changes you might introduce in order to emphasis these ideas within your
                     final project-- strategies to heighten, underscore, bring attention to the ideas at play (ie.
                     repetition, scale, duration, color etc.) Make a list.</p>
